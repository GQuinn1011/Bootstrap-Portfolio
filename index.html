                                <p>My name is Gabriel Quinn, I currently live in East Brunswick, but I'm originally from Jersey City. I've been married for 8 years. My wife and I have a son, his name is Benjamin. My interests are playing with my son, tinkering with technology, and hanging out with friends and family.  </p>

                                <p>In my freetime, I like to research current technology i.e. updates to mobile software, or the newest gadget to come out to market.  My friends and family don't understand my fascination, that is until they need something fixed! That is why I decided to do the coding bootcamp, to obtain skills that feed my thirst for knowledge.</p>
